            <h1>Muhammad Ahmed</h1>
            <p>Skills:</p> 
            <ul>JAVA</ul>
            <ul>C++(barely)</ul>
            <ul>Github</ul>
            <ul>Not too many programming skills sadly</ul>
            <p>My dad wanted a website for his business so I got a udemy course on web dev in 2016, I never got past Javascript cause that joint was confusing. Website never got made past the intial html/css stuff.</p>
            <p>I don't really have a philosphy when it comes to being an engineer, maybe try to be as ethical as possible but thats becoming harder and harder these days with all big tech being evil but your boy gotta eat right</p>
            <p>I worked as a software engineering intern over the previous summer at John Deere and it was very painful because my coding skills were not good and I did struggle a lot but they were good people and helped out and didn't complain about me too much lol.</p>
            <p>I worked for the MTA for almost 3 years in the Powder Department which was cool as hell but I got greedy and wanted more money so here I am. Hopefully there isn't a big tech busy since I decided to change careers.</p>
            <p>Hopefully by the end of this class I can get my dad his website after all these years, one can only hope.</p>
            <p>Ultimate goal, make this look less ugly.</p>
